## Technologies Used

- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript** - Typed JavaScript for better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Create React App** - React development environment

## Customization

The website includes:

- Responsive header with navigation
- Hero section with call-to-action buttons
- Footer
- Mobile-friendly design
- Full TypeScript support with proper type annotations

You can customize the design by modifying the Tailwind CSS classes in the components or extending the Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.js`.

## TypeScript Benefits

This project uses TypeScript which provides:

- Better IntelliSense and autocomplete
- Catch errors at compile time
- Better refactoring support
- Improved code documentation through types
- Enhanced developer experience

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build in the `build` folder that you can deploy to any static hosting service.
